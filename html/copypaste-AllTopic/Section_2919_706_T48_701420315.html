         <p class="p P">Contracting officers must collect annual and semiannual subcontracting reports from contractors with established subcontracting plans. Copies of the report, Standard Form 294 (Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts), and the report, Standard Form 295 (Summary Subcontracting Report), must be forwarded to the Director, Office of Small Business Programs, not later than the 30th day of the month following the close of the reporting period. If the contractor has not met the goals for the reporting period, the contracting officer will provide an acknowledgement to the contractor and request corrective action to be taken. If goals are not met in subsequent periods, the contracting officer must consider factors that would demonstrate a good faith effort, and take appropriate action including assessing liquidated damages in accordance with FAR 52.219-16, and/or not exercising subsequent option periods.
